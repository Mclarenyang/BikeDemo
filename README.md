## 1. Introduction
-----
### 1.1 Final Result (2Do)


### 1.2 Project Instruction
 This project is a native iOS app implementation that provides ride users with navigation, security, data and social travel apps. The main functions implemented are as follows:
1. Navigation module
    * Map
        * Map rendering options
        * Map point selection
        * Location inquiry
    * Cycling route planning
    * Navigation
2. Safety and instrument modules
    * display
        * Gradient speed dial
        * Speed, altitude, time and balance display (the maximum angle between the device screen and the horizontal plane)
    * Safety
        * Speed reminder
        * Fall detection and help SMS, phone trigger
    * Other
        * Extreme speed mode (does not trigger the function under the security directory)
        * Data record
3. Community module
    * Login to logout / registration
    * Homepage
    * Dynamically post, view, like, comment
    * Emergency SMS settings
    * Cycling data chart

 The project uses the iOS client as a sensing device, and the Matlab algorithm is combined with the iOS device test to generate a security threshold.

## 3.UI

I have a limited level of UI. In the development and design process, I mainly refer to the excellent design works of the Dribbble community. Here I have provided me with inspiration or design reference works, and I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the designers and sharers.üëçüëèüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
